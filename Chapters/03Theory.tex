\section{Reference Frames} \label{sec:Reference_Frames}

\subsection{Inertial ECI frame}
$\mathcal{F}^i$

\subsection{RTN frame}
x-axis (R) outwards from the position vector (radial direction), z-axis (N) pointing towards the cross product between the position and velocity vectors (along-track direction), y-axis (T) completing the right-handed system (cross-track direction). Denoted by $\mathcal{F}^r$
\begin{equation}
    \hat{R}^i_r = \frac{r^i_{c/e}}{||r^i_{c/e}||}, \qquad \hat{N}^i_r = \frac{r^i_{c/e} \times v^i_{c/e}}{||r^i_{c/e} \times v^i_{c/e}||}, \qquad \hat{T}^i_r = \hat{N}^i_r \times \hat{R}^i_r
\end{equation}
Here, $r^i_{c/e}$ and $v^i_{c/e}$ are the position and velocity vectors of the chief/leader relative to the Earth's center expressed in the inertial frame. The transformation between ECI and RTN frames is given by:
\begin{equation}
    R^i_r = \begin{bmatrix}
        \hat{R}^i_r & \hat{T}^i_r & \hat{N}^i_r
    \end{bmatrix}, \qquad R^r_i = (R^i_r)^T = \begin{bmatrix}
        (\hat{R}^i_r)^T \\
        (\hat{T}^i_r)^T \\
        (\hat{N}^i_r)^T
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Solar Radiation Pressure} \label{sec:Solar_Pressure}

Radiation is modeled by using solar flux at one astronomical unit and scaling by distance from the sun relative to 1 AU. The solar flux at one AU is taken as:

\begin{equation}
    SF_{AU} = 1372.5398 \; \left[ \frac{W}{m^2} \right]
\end{equation}

The cannonball model assumes the spacecraft is a simple sphere. The radiation pressure at 1AU, pSR, can be taken as the solar flux divided by the speed of light.

\begin{equation}
    p_{SR} = \frac{SF_{AU}}{c} \; \left[ \frac{N}{m^2} \right]
\end{equation}

Then, a “scaling factor” can be determined. This “scaling factor” is equivalent to the magnitude of the solar radiation force divided by the distance between the spacecraft and the sun:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{|\mathbf{F}_{\text{radiation}}|}{|\mathbf{r}_{\text{sun}}|} = 
    - c_R \, p_{SR} \, A_d \, \frac{AU^2}{|\mathbf{r}_{\text{sun}}|^3}
    \; \left[ \frac{N}{m} \right]
\end{equation}

rsun is the vector from the spacecraft to the sun in the spacecraft body frame and cR is the reflectivity. This factor is then multiplied by the position vector from the spacecraft to the sun to get the force on the spacecraft due to solar radiation pressure.

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{F}_{\text{radiation}} =
    \frac{|\mathbf{F}_{\text{radiation}}|}{|\mathbf{r}_{\text{sun}}|}
    \, \mathbf{r}_{\text{sun}} \; [N]
\end{equation}

\section{Equations}

A simple equation can be included as: \\

\begin{equation}
        r = 2\pi^{2}
        \label{eqn:simple_eqn}
\end{equation} \\


\noindent The text below shows an example of how to align equations on the equal sign, with only one reference for both. This may be useful for when they are linked and are actually only one equation but splitting them up makes it more readable. \\

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
        a &= \sin^{2}(\Delta\phi/2) + \cos(\phi_{1})\cdot\cos(\phi_{2})\cdot\sin^{2}(\Delta\lambda/2)\\
        d &= 2R\cdot\arcsin(\sqrt{a})
\end{aligned}
\label{eqn:haversine}
\end{equation} \\

\noindent The whole equation can be referenced as "equation \eqref{eqn:haversine}", here showing the Haversine formula. One may also align sub-equations such that they are numbered the same but have a letter differentiating them as shown below. This can be used when they are linked, but you will need to reference both individual parts.

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    SSD 
        & \quad = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\vec{x_{i}}-\vec{\mu_{q}})^{2} \label{eq:ssd}\\[15pt] %creates more space between the sub-equations
    SSE 
        & \quad = \sum_{q=1}^{k} \delta_{rq} SSD \label{eq:sse}
\end{align}
\label{eqn:subeqn}
\end{subequations} \\

\noindent These equations can be refrenced by their spesific sub-equation as "equation \eqref{eq:ssd}", or by the whole group as "equations \eqref{eqn:subeqn}". The "double backslashes" in the .tex creates line spaces and gives more room around the equations and paragraphs. Use them as you think feels right. 



\section{Tables and footnotes}

Here is an example of both a regular table with data and a table with split headers, for scientific usage. Do not use horizontal/vertical rulers between the data, or encase the table with rulers. \\

\section{A single figure}

Figure \ref{fig:latlong} is included as an example. The square brackets before the caption description contains the title of the figure, which is what will be written in the list of figures. This should be short and concise. The same layout applies to tables and other floats. Remember to change the title as well as the caption if you are copying these examples. In the list of figures and tables all the different floats will be grouped together by chapter. Remember to always reference all your figures and tables in the text at least once.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}


\section{Citations}

Here are some examples on how to reference a source (where none is relevant to the text but just for illustration purposes only). One may cite a single reference by calling \cite{wolves_of_mount_mckinley}, or several in the same bracket by calling \cite{machine_learning, clustering_impossibility} when they are all related to the same statement. There are many different styles on how to cite, and how the layout and order of your citation style is presented. This is my favorite, as I find it neat and tidy \cite{sheep}. It will show up in order of appearance in the references section.
