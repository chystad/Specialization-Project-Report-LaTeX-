% The title page:
% For NTNU students this page will be generated automatically when submitting your paper, and should not be included in the final file from Latex. Delete or comment out the title page setup. The final report should then start with the first page being the abstract. I have included a title page here so it is possible to see how it may look like, and for those who does not get an automatically generated title page. Of course you will need to change the names and titles etc. to your case.

%the title page should be an odd page (right hand side)
